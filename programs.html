      <h2>How We Measure Impact</h2>
      <p> We measure impact using a mix of quantitative metrics (like numbers of children vaccinated, increased school enrollment, or improved literacy scores) and qualitative methods (such as beneficiary testimonials, case studies, focus groups, and interviews that capture personal stories and community changes). These approaches are guided by frameworks like logic models and theories of change, and involve collecting data through surveys and assessments to demonstrate effectiveness, accountability, and to inform strategic decisions and attract funding. KPIs include stable housing placements, improved nutrition markers, school attendance, and academic progress. Quarterly reports are published to maintain transparency.</p>
