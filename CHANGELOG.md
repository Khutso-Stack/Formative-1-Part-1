## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-26
### Added
- **Homepage gallery** section using local images (`Kids-post-image.jpg`, `meal.jpg`, `classroom.jpg`, `school.jpg`, `shelter.jpg`) with captions.
- **Responsive screenshots** (mobile & desktop) added under `/docs/screenshots/` and referenced in README.
- `aria-current="page"` on active nav links for better accessibility feedback.

### Changed
- **Mobile navigation UX:** nav is non-sticky ‚â§768px, row+wrap layout, smaller paddings for more content space.
- **Hero overlay tuning** for better legibility and image visibility (lighter gradient).
- Standardised image usage across pages: removed inline `width/height`, rely on CSS `object-fit: cover`; where applicable, added `srcset/sizes` or `image-set`.

### Fixed
- Broken gallery images due to filename/path mismatches (case-sensitive on GitHub Pages).
- Conflicting mobile nav rules at the same breakpoint (removed column stack rule).
- Duplicate/weak `alt` text‚Äîimproved descriptive alts on gallery and hero images.
- Ensured embedded Google Maps are fully responsive inside `.map-wrap`.

### Docs
- README updated with **live site link**, structured **Responsive Screenshots** tables, and clearer run/deploy instructions.
- Noted breakpoints (980px, 900px, 768px, 680px) and accessibility features (`:focus-visible`, reduced motion).
